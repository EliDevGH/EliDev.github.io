## Execution

To execute the JSON transformer code, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Python installed on your local machine.

Copy the provided JSON transformer code into a new Python file (e.g., json_transformer.py).

Save the input JSON to a file (e.g., input.json) in the same directory as the Python file.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file and input JSON are located.

Run the following command to execute the code:

bash
Copy code
python json_transformer.py
The transformed output JSON will be printed to the console.

Please note that you may need to adjust the file names and paths in the code if you choose different names for the Python file and input JSON.

If you prefer to execute the code on Replit, follow these steps:

Go to the Replit website and create a new Replit account (if you don't have one).
Create a new Python Replit by selecting the Python language template.
Copy the provided JSON transformer code and replace the default code in the Replit editor.
Save the input JSON as a Replit file by clicking on the "Add file" button in the left sidebar and entering the file name (e.g., input.json).
Adjust the file name/path in the code if necessary to match the Replit file.
Click the "Run" button in the Replit editor to execute the code.
The transformed output JSON will be displayed in the Replit console.
